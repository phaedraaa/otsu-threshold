# otsu-threshold
 Implemented Otsuâ€™s image thresholding algorithm in both serial and parallel versions using C, MPI, and
 OpenMP. Conducted performance analysis across different image sizes and processor/thread counts, eval
uating speedup and efficiency to highlight the trade-offs between distributed (MPI) and shared-memory
 (OpenMP) parallelization in image processing
